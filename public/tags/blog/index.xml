      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was 16, I launched my blog site with blogpost.com (now blogger.com).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You say why I blog? Well, my parents did not manage to get a hold of a computer yet during that period. So what I did was, wrote a journal but wouldn’t call it a journal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You see, the way I did it was to write in a ‘magazine’ look and format where there will be so-called “ads” for the stuff I find interesting. There are 3 versions of this which will remain offline for keepsake and nostalgic moments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo-is-a-static-site-generator&#34;&gt;Hugo is a static site generator&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduced by my good friend of mind back in Secondary school. I straight away fell in love in static sites. I have been dabbling into WordPress thinking that it is the &amp;lsquo;Holy Grail&amp;rsquo; of web development. &lt;em&gt;buzzz!!&lt;/em&gt; Nope. I was totally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tasnim, actually first started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gethugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; for his own personal blog. He thought me a lot about how VS Code works, this is the point where I discovered the term IDE, he is darn good at explaining complex things into simple terms. Which struck me like a lightning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I live in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Specifically, Western part of Johor. Near Legoland Malaysia.&#xA;In my area, there aren&amp;rsquo;t many groceries store around, there about 6 supermarkets nearby (at least 10-30 mins). Further than that, I do not consider it nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6 supermarkets may sound a lot for some. But not to me because most of them sell the same things. Say for an example, I could not find any natural sea salt in most of the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since my late mom bought the house I currently live in, it is still in the original, unadorned state. My late mom did not opt for any renovations or even fancy decorations and pieces of furniture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that my mom did was the kitchen cabinet and countertop which was not included when we got this house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, we got it first-hand, brand-new back in around 2014.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
