&lt;p>My wife recently is interested to make her own sourdough, thanks to B.E.N (You can refer to the post I talk about B.E.N, a grocery store. Click &lt;a href="https://alterego.berlime.com/posts/ben/">Here&lt;/a>) Sourdough have a lot of variety, types, shape, taste &amp;amp; purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommend Goat Cheese Sandwhich to go with. It is a classic sandwhich that consists of a slice of sour dough, a thick slice of goat cheese, drizzle with olive oil and season it with some salt and black pepper. Toast it for about 5 minutes, and for the extra touch, blow torch the top surface to have some smoked/charred taste. Or if you somehow have a &lt;a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/guide/969/what-is-a-salamander-oven.html">salamander&lt;/a>, a cooking equipment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SEO Partnership</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/seo-partnership/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 22:46:14 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/seo-partnership/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="new-seo-service">New SEO Service&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Today marks the journey of introducing a new suite of services to my agency. Before we dive in, let me tell you a story about why offering SEO services may not be as easy as spinning up a new product line. You see, running an agency has its own challenges, especially with limited resources in terms of manpower and financial capabilities. My agency&amp;rsquo;s core product offers a web development service. This service alone involves thousands of technicalities that require a certain level of skillset.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alter Ego 2 - First Post</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/alter-ego-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/alter-ego-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I was 16, I launched my blog site with blogpost.com (now blogger.com).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You say why I blog? Well, my parents did not manage to get a hold of a computer yet during that period. So what I did was, wrote a journal but wouldn’t call it a journal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You see, the way I did it was to write in a ‘magazine’ look and format where there will be so-called “ads” for the stuff I find interesting. There are 3 versions of this which will remain offline for keepsake and nostalgic moments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Food Delivery Rider</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/food-delivery-rider/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/food-delivery-rider/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="lets-compare-between-working-full-time--being-a-food-delivery-rider-also-full-time">Let&amp;rsquo;s Compare Between Working Full-time &amp;amp; Being a Food Delivery Rider, Also Full Time&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Working as a Foodpanda food delivery rider for 21 days, which is the same as working full-time at about 7 to excluding lunch &amp;amp; small breaks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On average per day $100 * 21 days = $2100&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="operation-cost--">Operation cost: -&lt;/h3>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Meals: Around $6 per day (Eat in JB, 1 drink in SG). 6*21=126 
Petrol: $6 per day. 6*21=126 
Total operation cost: 126+126=336 
Take home cash: 2100-336=1764 
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>So, this equals to a salary of $2624 working full-time with a take home cash of $2100 after deduction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I use Hugo for this blog.</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/hugo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 20:37:34 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/hugo/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="hugo-is-a-static-site-generator">Hugo is a static site generator.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Introduced by my good friend of mind back in Secondary school. I straight away fell in love in static sites. I have been dabbling into WordPress thinking that it is the Holy Grail of web development. &lt;em>buzzz!!&lt;/em> nope. I was totally wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasnim, actually first started using Hugo for his own personal blog. He thought me a lot about how VSCODE works, he is darn good at explaining complex things into simple terms. Which struck me like a lightning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>B.E.N!</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/ben/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/ben/</guid><description>&lt;p>I live in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Specifically, Western part of Johor. Near Legoland Malaysia.
In my area, there aren&amp;rsquo;t many groceries store around, there about 6 supermarkets nearby (at least 10-30 mins). Further than that, I do not consider it nearby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>6 supermarkets may sound a lot for some. But not to me because most of them sell the same things. Say for an example, I could not find any natural sea salt in most of the supermarket.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notion</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/notion/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 23:25:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/notion/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="notionso---the-superpower-i-stumble-upon">Notion.so - The Superpower I Stumble Upon&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Notion is an app that you can decide on how do you want it to be. It is generally a note taking app. On steroids, if you want it.
You can choose to make it as simple as a regular note taking app, or you can also turn it into a &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;super app&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> like how I did, to run my agency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also run an internal finance insights for my agency. You see, having an accountant running a business is a must have. Even when you subscribe a software to comply with the regulations. You still have some sort of limitation in manipulating your finance like setting aside budgets, create internal accounts for a certain category of stuffs. Well, Notion allows me to do that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nurusysyabab</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/nurusysyabab/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 20:25:16 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/nurusysyabab/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-different-approach">A different approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have been using Elementor builder for a WordPress project. No doubt it is a great tool for me to start or in fact, anyone! This is the builder that I used when I first discovered WordPress. (The right way LOL) - &lt;em>will definitely blog about this.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quickly discovered that there are bunch of options you can include the tech-stack for your WordPress journey. Thanks to the nature of a technology, which tends to change/updates really fast. The theme that I used realesed a native &amp;lsquo;Full-Site Editing&amp;rsquo; experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WP Meet Up</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/wp-meet-up/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 22:56:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/wp-meet-up/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello there!

&lt;p>Ever since my late mom bought the house I currently live in, it is still in the original, unadorned state. My late mom did not opt for any renovations or even fancy decorations and pieces of furniture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only thing that my mom did was the kitchen cabinet and countertop which was not included when we got this house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh yeah, we got it first-hand, brand new back in around 2014.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
