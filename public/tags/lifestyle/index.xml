&lt;p>My wife recently is interested to make her own sourdough, thanks to B.E.N (You can refer to the post I talk about B.E.N, a grocery store. Click &lt;a href="https://alterego.berlime.com/posts/ben/">Here&lt;/a>) Sourdough have a lot of variety, types, shape, taste &amp;amp; purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommend Goat Cheese Sandwhich to go with. It is a classic sandwhich that consists of a slice of sour dough, a thick slice of goat cheese, drizzle with olive oil and season it with some salt and black pepper. Toast it for about 5 minutes, and for the extra touch, blow torch the top surface to have some smoked/charred taste. Or if you somehow have a &lt;a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/guide/969/what-is-a-salamander-oven.html">salamander&lt;/a>, a cooking equipment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>B.E.N!</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/ben/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/ben/</guid><description>&lt;p>I live in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Specifically, Western part of Johor. Near Legoland Malaysia.
In my area, there aren&amp;rsquo;t many groceries store around, there about 6 supermarkets nearby (at least 10-30Â mins). Further than that, I do not consider it nearby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>6 supermarkets may sound a lot for some. But not to me because most of them sell the same things. Say for an example, I could not find any natural sea salt in most of the supermarket.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
