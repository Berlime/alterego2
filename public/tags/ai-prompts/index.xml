<description>&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Bank Statement Transaction Extraction Prompt

## Task Overview
Analyze the uploaded PDF bank statement and extract credit card transaction data from all relevant pages in a format suitable for Excel import.

## Instructions

### 1. Page Selection
- **First, scan through all pages** to identify which pages contain credit card transactions
- Look for sections labeled &amp;#34;Credit Card Transactions&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Card Purchases&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Credit Card Activity&amp;#34;, or similar headings
- Focus exclusively on pages that contain individual credit card transaction entries
- Ignore pages with only account summaries, payment totals, interest charges, or footer content
- Extract only individual credit card transaction entries (purchases, payments, fees, etc.)

### 2. Data Extraction Requirements
For each credit card transaction, extract the following fields in this exact order:
1. **Transaction Description** (merchant name/transaction details)
2. **Transaction Date** (format: YYYY-MM-DD or DD/MM/YYYY - maintain consistency)
3. **Transaction Amount** (use negative for purchases; if &amp;#34;CR&amp;#34; suffix is present, make the numerical value negative and retain the &amp;#34;CR&amp;#34; suffix; other payments/credits positive)
4. **WHO** (determined by analyzing the transaction - see WHO Assignment Rules below)
5. **Check List**
6. **eStatements**

### 3. WHO Assignment Rules
**CRITICAL**: Analyze each transaction to determine who it belongs to:
- If the **Transaction Amount has suffix &amp;#34;CR&amp;#34;** (credit amount) → assign **&amp;#34;MINUS&amp;#34;**
- If the **Transaction Description contains &amp;#34;PETRON&amp;#34;** (case-insensitive) → assign **&amp;#34;KAMIL&amp;#34;**
- If the **Transaction Amount equals &amp;#34;15.90&amp;#34;** (exactly) → assign **&amp;#34;KAMIL&amp;#34;**
- For all other transactions → leave **WHO field blank** or assign based on other patterns you identify

**Priority Order**: Check for &amp;#34;CR&amp;#34; suffix first, then apply other rules if no &amp;#34;CR&amp;#34; is found.

### 4. Output Format
Present the data as a **Markdown table** with these exact column headers:

 ```markdown
 | Transaction Description | Transaction Date | Transaction Amount | WHO | Check List | eStatements |
 |-------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------|------------|-------------|
 | PETRON GAS STATION | 2024-01-15 | 45.20 | KAMIL | | |
 | WALMART SUPERCENTER | 2024-01-16 | 127.45 | | | |
 | COFFEE SHOP DOWNTOWN | 2024-01-17 | 15.90 | KAMIL | | |
 | PAYMENT RECEIVED | 2024-01-18 | -500.00 CR | MINUS | | |
 | PETRON FUEL STOP | 2024-01-19 | 52.30 | KAMIL | | |
 | REFUND PROCESSING | 2024-01-20 | -25.75 CR | MINUS | | |
 ```

**Important**:
- Format as a standard Markdown table.

### 5. Data Cleaning Instructions
- Remove currency symbols but **PRESERVE &amp;#34;CR&amp;#34; suffix** in transaction amounts
- Ensure consistent date formatting throughout
- If the **Transaction Amount has a &amp;#39;CR&amp;#39; suffix**, convert its numerical value to negative but **PRESERVE the &amp;#39;CR&amp;#39; suffix**.
- Trim extra spaces from transaction descriptions
- If amounts are in parentheses (), treat as negative/debit amounts
- **Apply WHO assignment rules consistently to every transaction**
- **Keep &amp;#34;CR&amp;#34; suffix visible** in the Transaction Amount column for identification
- Preserve original transaction descriptions but clean up formatting

### 6. Quality Checks
- Verify that all credit card transaction pages have been identified and processed
- Check that transaction amounts and dates are consistent with credit card statement logic
- **Verify WHO assignments**: Double-check that all amounts with &amp;#34;CR&amp;#34; suffix are marked as MINUS
- **Verify WHO assignments**: Double-check that all PETRON transactions are marked as KAMIL
- **Verify WHO assignments**: Double-check that all 15.90 amount transactions are marked as KAMIL
- Flag any unclear or partially visible transactions
- Note any pages that may be cut off or illegible

### 7. Special Handling
- If a credit card transaction spans multiple lines, combine into single row
- For recurring charges (subscriptions, etc.), maintain individual entries with dates
- If page contains sub-totals, interest charges, or fees, include these as separate transaction types
- Handle different transaction types (Purchase, Payment, Fee, Interest, Credit, etc.) consistently
- Look for both current month transactions and any pending/recent transactions
- **Priority**: Always apply WHO assignment rules before finalizing each transaction row

## Expected Output Structure

Please provide:
1. **Summary**: &amp;#34;Found credit card transactions on pages [X, Y, Z] - Extracted [N] total transactions&amp;#34;
2. **Markdown table format**
3. **Notes**: Any irregularities, unclear entries, formatting issues, or pages that contained credit card data

## Additional Notes
- The output should be immediately copy-pasteable into Excel
- Use **tabs** between columns for proper Excel formatting
- If any transaction data is unclear or partially visible, note this separately
- Maintain chronological order as shown in the original statement
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>
