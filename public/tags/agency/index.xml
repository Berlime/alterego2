&lt;p>First, we need to determine the minmax of the cuts for each corner. This cuts must be relative to the width and the length.
The goal is to allow users to customize order not just by adding rounded corners on the required sides, but also, allows granular measurement for irregular shapes, and routing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All I knew about GitHub was some sort of place where you dump codes and make it available to the public. But still, I have no idea what is the purpose of it, at all. Until Tasnim, enlightened me what it really was.
See, of course I&amp;rsquo;ve watched a few YouTube videos of what GitHub is, I kind of get the idea but do not know how it works, what is it for, etcetera.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SEO Partnership</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/seo-partnership/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 22:46:14 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/seo-partnership/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="new-seo-service">New SEO Service&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Today marks the journey of introducing a new suite of services to my agency. Before we dive in, let me tell you a story about why offering SEO services may not be as easy as spinning up a new product line. You see, running an agency has its own challenges, especially with limited resources in terms of manpower and financial capabilities. My agency&amp;rsquo;s core product offers a web development service. This service alone involves thousands of technicalities that require a certain level of skillset.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notion</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/notion/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 23:25:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/notion/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="notionso---the-superpower-i-stumble-upon">Notion.so - The Superpower I Stumble Upon&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Notion is an app that you can decide on how do you want it to be. It is generally a note taking app. On steroids, if you want it.
You can choose to make it as simple as a regular note taking app, or you can also turn it into a &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;super app&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> like how I did, to run my agency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also run an internal finance insights for my agency. You see, having an accountant running a business is a must have. Even when you subscribe a software to comply with the regulations. You still have some sort of limitation in manipulating your finance like setting aside budgets, create internal accounts for a certain category of stuffs. Well, Notion allows me to do that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Funnel</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/funnel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 13:08:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/funnel/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>You can read more about Tofu &lt;a href="https://getwpfunnels.com/top-of-the-funnel/">here&lt;/a>. A funnel is basically a terminology used to generate leads. It is basically a way to filter through visitors or people that captures their attention into your business. Eventually turning them into paying visitors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, Tofu is exactly how it sounds like. We first bring people into the funnel which is the widest part of the funnel. The wide part of the funnel, is called &amp;rsquo;top of the funnel&amp;quot;. Which essentially what people see when they first enter your funnel.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nurusysyabab</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/nurusysyabab/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 20:25:16 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/nurusysyabab/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-different-approach">A different approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have been using Elementor builder for a WordPress project. No doubt it is a great tool for me to start or in fact, anyone! This is the builder that I used when I first discovered WordPress. (The right way LOL) - &lt;em>will definitely blog about this.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quickly discovered that there are bunch of options you can include the tech-stack for your WordPress journey. Thanks to the nature of a technology, which tends to change/updates really fast. The theme that I used realesed a native &amp;lsquo;Full-Site Editing&amp;rsquo; experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Agency</title><link>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/my-agency/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 13:08:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://alterego2.vercel.app/posts/my-agency/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
