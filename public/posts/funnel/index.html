<h2 id="first-berlimes-funnel-tofu-aka-top-of-the-funnel">First Berlime&rsquo;s Funnel (TOFU <em>a.k.a Top Of the Funnel</em>)</h2>
<p>You can read more about Tofu <a href="https://getwpfunnels.com/top-of-the-funnel/">here</a>. A funnel is basically a terminology used to generate leads. It is basically a way to filter through visitors or people that captures their attention into your business. Eventually turning them into paying visitors.</p>
<p>So, Tofu is exactly how it sounds like. We first bring people into the funnel which is the widest part of the funnel. The wide part of the funnel, is called &rsquo;top of the funnel&quot;. Which essentially what people see when they first enter your funnel.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-funnel-is-not-as-easy-as-i-thought">Creating a funnel is not as easy as I thought.</h3>
<p>At first, I outlined in a simple list format, to the things I wanted to share when people enter my funnel. Then when I started to dive into it further, turning it into a diagram format which also telling me the visuals of what are the steps taken when they enter the funnel. Turns out, I overlooked tonnes of stages.</p>
<p>My goal is to send them a few e-mails and a free e-guide (PDF). Setting it up took me and my team almost 2 quarters to complete as we are complete beginners and never ever done this in our entire journey of web development.</p>
<p>This process realises that there are a lot more things to work on to run my agency.</p>
<h3 id="now-that-i-know-i-took-it-slowly-and-took-a-practical-approach">Now that I know, I took it slowly and took a practical approach.</h3>
<p>I use to plan a lot of things in a quarter, like 10 projects to complete. But the process of creating a simple Funnel made me realise our capacity. My capacity, and my team&rsquo;s capacity. Turns out, we do not have the luxury of time and knowledge to execute new things.</p>
<p>This event, leads us to eventually take it slowly, one at a time and decide to work on only 3 projects for each quarter. On top of the &ldquo;must-do&rdquo; work like administritative tasks, meetings, cold calls, maintenance and other necessary taks.</p>
<h3 id="our-funnel-done">Our Funnel done.</h3>
<p>Can you imagine that this project was supposed to be completed in the first quarter of this year, but we only completed it in the 3rd quarter. It was a mess and a lesson learn the hard way.</p>
<p>All I want to say today is, sometimes we need to takes things slowly and do not rush to complete things. This is afterall an internal thing, I mean, it does not involve any clients or urgent matters that could lose a fortune. With that, we are much more capable now of analysing which projects to execute first and which ones that could bring us more traction. Versus just creating it and chase a deadline that no one asks for.</p>
