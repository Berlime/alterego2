        <h2 id="first-berlimes-funnel-tofu-aka-top-of-the-funnel">First Berlime&rsquo;s Funnel (TOFU <em>a.k.a Top Of the Funnel</em>)</h2>
<p>You can read more about Tofu <a href="https://getwpfunnels.com/top-of-the-funnel/">here</a>. A funnel is basically a terminology used to generate leads. It is basically a way to filter through visitors or people that captures their attention into your business. Eventually turning them into paying visitors. It&rsquo;s an abbreviation for &ldquo;Top Of the Funnel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, Tofu is exactly how it sounds like. We first bring people into the funnel which is the widest and &rsquo;top&rsquo; of the funnel. Which essentially what people see when they first enter your funnel.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-funnel-is-not-as-easy-as-i-thought">Creating a funnel is not as easy as I thought</h3>
<p>At first, I outlined in a simple list format, to the things I wanted to share when people enter my funnel. Then, when I started to dive into it further, turning it into a diagram format which also telling me the visuals of what are the steps taken when they enter the funnel. Turns out, I overlooked tonnes of stages.</p>
<p>My goal is to send them a few e-mails and a free e-guide (PDF). Setting it up took me and my team almost 2 quarters to complete as we are complete beginners and never ever done this in our entire journey of web development.</p>
<p>This process realizes that there are a lot more things to work on to run my agency.</p>
<h3 id="now-that-i-know-i-took-it-slowly-and-took-a-practical-approach">Now that I know, I took it slowly and took a practical approach</h3>
<p>I used to plan a lot of things in a quarter, like 10 projects to complete. But the process of creating a simple Funnel made me realize our current capacity. Turns out, we do not have the luxury of time and knowledge to execute new things.</p>
<p>This event, leads us to eventually take it slow, one at a time and decide to work on only 3 projects for each quarter. On top of the &ldquo;must-do&rdquo; work like administrative tasks, meetings, cold calls, maintenance and other necessary tasks.</p>
<h3 id="our-funnel-done">Our Funnel done</h3>
<p>Can you imagine that this project was supposed to be completed in the first quarter of this year, only to find ourselves completed it in the 3rd quarter? It was a mess and a lesson learned, the hard way.</p>
<p>All I want to say today is, I want to emphasize the importance of taking things slowly and not rushing to complete tasks. Since this is an internal matter, it does not involve any clients or urgent issues that could result in significant losses. By doing so, we can better analyze which projects to prioritize and which ones will bring us more traction, instead of hastily creating something to meet an unnecessary deadline.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-just-take-your-time">Conclusion: Just Take Your Time</h3>
<p>Taking your time can be incredibly valuable. When we slow down, we allow ourselves the space to think more clearly, make better decisions, and produce higher quality work. Rushing often leads to mistakes and unnecessary stress. By taking a measured approach, we can prioritize effectively, focus on what truly matters, and avoid the pressure of artificial deadlines. This mindset also fosters creativity and innovation, as we give our ideas the time they need to develop fully. Remember, it&rsquo;s not about how quickly we finish, but how well we accomplish our goals. Patience can be a powerful ally.</p>
