2025 felt like the louder sequel to [2024](/posts/2024). I spent most of the year inside WordPress halls, iterating on agency systems, and trying to make healthier defaults stick.

## The WordPress Year

2025 turned out to be my biggest WordPress community year yet. I kept stacking roles, events, and conversations until the calendar looked like a fully booked content plan.

WordCamp Johor Bahru 2025 landed at [42 Iskandar Puteri](https://42kl.edu.my/) on May 17. I helped run [WordCamp Johor Bahru 2025](https://johor.wordcamp.org/2025/) as part of the organizing team handling social media, and the lucky draw streak decided to continue.

[WordCamp Malaysia 2025](https://malaysia.wordcamp.org/2025/) in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya was the most electric WordCamp I have attended so far. I expanded the network, had honest chats about sponsorship decks, and somehow walked away with another lucky draw prize.

Supporting the community felt even better as an Iron Sponsor for WordCamp Malaysia. That was my first time sliding into the sponsor roster and I am already planning the next one.

I also returned to the WordPress Meet Up Johor Bahru stage to talk about [Notion](/posts/Notion) for the second time. Notion has been the brain of the agency so it felt good to show a practical version instead of a bullet list of features.

WordCamp Campus Connect kept the momentum going. I served as speaker lead, AV lead, and speaker, and working with the [WordCamp Campus Connect](https://events.wordpress.org/campus-connect/) crew reminded me why volunteer teams still feel like family.

## The Side Hustle Chapter

Agency life finally felt less chaotic. I spent time solidifying the productivity systems so briefs, revisions, and QA do not steal creative time. The workflows are simpler now which means fewer late night fire drills.

WooCommerce became the next experiment. I have been moving slow and steady from Shopee to a proper store on my own domain. The side project helps subsidize cost of living and doubles as a test bed for productized services I want to ship to clients.

## The Personal Wins

Coffee got personal this year. I wanted to ditch the three-in-one sachets so I started buying beans thanks to Tasnim and Ridhwan nudging me to taste better stuff. Now I grind small batches, dial in the brew, and start each morning without the sugar crash.

QuitSure became my accountability buddy for smoking. The [QuitSure app](https://www.quitsure.app/) tracks cravings, reflections, and milestones which keeps me honest while I work on quitting entirely.

If any of this helps or if you want to swap WordPress or coffee stories, just drop me a note at kamil@berlime.com, I am around.
