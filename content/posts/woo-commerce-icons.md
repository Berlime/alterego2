## Use case

Client requested a custom order status, for context, there are a lot of ways to do this.
I recommend getting plug-ins from Yith which obviously adds up to their commitment.

I wasn't sure if they are okay with the add ons, so I just went ahead and create a low fidelity order status and send customer note when the order the status changes.

I will share the code some other time but for now.

I found a useful link that WooCommerce uses for their icons.

I Googled 'PHP WooCommerce Icon Library' and this [link](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/) pops out.

Hope this helps
