Creating anchor links in Bricks is straightforward. You just need to set an ID on the target section and link to it.

## Set Up the Target Section

1. Select the section you want to link to
2. Go to **Style > CSS > CSS ID**
3. Set an ID (e.g., `my-section`)

## Create the Link

1. Select your button or text element
2. Set the Link type to **External URL**
3. For the URL, enter `#my-section` (the hash followed by your ID)

That's it. The link will now jump to that section.

## Smooth Scrolling

By default, the jump is instant. If you want smooth scrolling, go to **Bricks Settings** and enable the smooth scroll option.
