Encountered Keystatic errors to display in Dev Mode. On Node version 22.
Will switch to the previous version and see if it resolves the issue.

Changing your Node.js version is quite straightforward. Here are a couple of methods you can use:

### Using NVM (Node Version Manager)

1. **Install NVM**: If you haven't already, install NVM by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **List Available Versions**: Check the available Node.js versions:

   ```sh
   nvm list-remote
   ```

3. **Install a Specific Version**: Install the desired Node.js version:

   ```sh
   nvm install <version>
   ```

   Replace `<version>` with the version number you want, for example, `nvm install 14.17.0`.

4. **Switch Between Versions**: To switch between installed versions:

   ```sh
   nvm use <version>
   ```

   Replace `<version>` with the version number you want to use.

### Using NPM (Node Package Manager)

1. **Install `n`**: Install the `n` package globally:

   ```sh
   npm install -g n
   ```

2. **Switch to a Specific Version**: Use the `n` command to switch to a specific Node.js version:

   ```sh
   n <version>
   ```

   Replace `<version>` with the version number you want, for example, `n 14.17.0`.

3. **Check the Current Version**: Verify the current Node.js version:

   ```sh
   node -v
   ```
