# Archive templates

This is a good video I found to create `Archive Templates` with WordPress's native `Blog/Post Page`, `Categories Page` etc.

The video tutorial is especially good if you want multiple CPT's archive page to look the same.

In my case, I create a Single template that is used for `Posts` archive page and `Post Category` archive page.
