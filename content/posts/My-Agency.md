Hello there, this is the first blog post about my agency.

I run a web design and development agency. I started out small by creating a website for my wedding business. This was before the Covid-19 pandemic.

The sole purpose to create a website for my wedding business is to seamlessly connect multiple providers and customers without having to communicate with me as a middle-man.

It is a system I developed. The goal is to create [an app a.k.a SaaS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Software-as-a-Service) for everyone to use, basically a all in one web portal for weddings. This needs a lot of hours for research and development. I would probably scrap this idea for now as it is not practical for me and my agency at the moment. More on that some other time, keep a look-out at my "agency" tagged blog post for updates.

I successfully launched my wedding business's website. Then, the whole world is on a lockdown (due to Covid-19). Which results to zero wedding activities. All booking deposit payments made by customers was refunded and there was no business. I was stuck, clueless and depressed on how I am going to sustain.

Long story short, I decide to offer creating website for my friends and families. Since I am able to create on my own for my wedding business. Little did I know it had snowballed into something significant.

So that was a brief introduction how my agency started. Now, let's talk about more on the progress on my web agency.

My agency's website, [berlime.com](https://berlime.com) runs on WordPress with Elementor builder. See, without prior experience the way I develop is whole lot of mess. It lacks standardization, maintainability and no design system.
This week, I finally dive deeper to revamp the website.

This time, with proper planning, hierarchy, framework, design system and lots of other structures including the server side of things.

I will revamp the pricing range to accommodate more unique businesses, entities & professionals. Providing seamless maintenance with fewer headaches for our clientele, especially in terms of the jargon and technicalities.

This week, marks and onboarding of the new website and also the whole system. The codename for this project is "two-o" which basically means Berlime 2.0, a versioning scheme I came up with. Which is much more business driven rather than freelancing, previously.

Keep a look-out on my next "agency" tagged post to follow my journey in my small agency in hopes that you have some takeaways and ideas that could be implemented in whatever you do.

Till next time!
