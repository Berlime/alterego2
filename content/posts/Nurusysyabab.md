## A different approach

I have been using Elementor builder for a WordPress project. No doubt it is a great tool for me to start or in fact, anyone! This is the builder that I used when I first discovered WordPress. (The right way LOL) - *will definitely blog about this.*

I quickly discovered that there are bunches of options you can include the tech-stack for your WordPress journey. Thanks to the nature of a technology, which tends to change/updates really fast. The theme that I used released a native 'Full-Site Editing' experience.

Which also introduced at the same time of the release by WordPress. It is called Spectra.

Without fancy features, pretty much straight forward, clean overall look. I decide to give it a try for a good friend of mine that runs his own traditional music ensemble.

### The challenging part

If you visited the site, I tried creating the hero section where a few elements overlap each other. I took quite sometime for me to achieve the best look for all types of screen sizes. This is actually the first so-called hero section with overlapping images, interfaces, elements and some texts.

This is the part that I realize I am terrible at designing elements. xD
