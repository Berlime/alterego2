## Let's Compare Between Working Full-time & Being a Food Delivery Rider, Also Full Time

Working as a Foodpanda food delivery rider for 21 days, which is the same as working full-time at about 7 to excluding lunch & small breaks.

On average per day $100 * 21 days = $2100

### Operation cost: -

    Meals: Around $6 per day (Eat in JB, 1 drink in SG). 6*21=126 
    Petrol: $6 per day. 6*21=126 
    Total operation cost: 126+126=336   
    Take home cash: 2100-336=1764 

So, this equals to a salary of $2624 working full-time with a take home cash of $2100 after deduction.

### Average working days per month 21:-

Now let's see how is the operation cost if we work full-time.

    Operation cost:-
    Meals: $16 per day. 16*21=336 
    Petrol: $2 per day. 2*21=42
    Total operation cost: 336+42=378 
    Take home cash: 2100-378=1722 

Now we know the comparison if we work panda on working days on every month. The difference of the 'take home cash' is not significant. While doing food delivery, the major cons is:

    - Requires physical energy. 
    - Nuances of the weather.
    - Risky as most of the time is on the road.
    - Requires more petrol.

The only cons working full-time in an office is, I to spend more on meals. That's it. Just one.

In conclusion, with the small difference of the take home cash, working full-time is far appealing.

But now let's count our commitment to see how if $2100 take home pay is actually enough in the first place.

Here is a simple list of the bills we need to consider:

    - Mortgage: $670
    - Property maintenance: $57
    - Vehicles: $461
    - Vehicle maintenance: $30
    - Petrol: $125
    - Utility Bills: $150
    - Phone: $70
    - Groceries: $100
    - Meals: $100
    - Insurance: $375
    - Family: $50
    - Shopping: $100

Well that's a lot, but I believe these are the essentials. So let's calculate.
*Not so much tho cause the above lists, most expenses are in MYR.

    670+57+461+30+125+150+70+100+100+375+50+100=2,288 

So, the minimum take home pay should be $2288, which is $2860 monthly salary if on payroll.
Now we know that an average of $100 for 21 days is not enough.

We would want to earn at least $110 per day for 21 days as a food delivery rider.

So, my previous schedule up is 2 weekday which is targeted at $200. And 2 weekends targeted at $400.
That is a total of $600 per week, which is enough for what we have aimed for.

However, in my current situation, I tend to skip some days to work on my web-design business.

The main purpose on why I still consider working full-time even though that everyone knows that doing food delivery can get us more in terms of financial. But considering the risks that we have discussed before. Doing food delivery is not sustainable in the long term.

With that, my conclusion is if I were to work full-time. The bare minimum is a $2860 monthly salary.
See, I'm not sure about you, but I don't think I can live on bare minimum.

I want some financial breathing space and try something new, travel to places.

My take home money should be at least $3000. Which is about $4761 monthly salary.

But of course, I wouldnâ€™t mind if my monthly between S$3500 - S$3000. :)
