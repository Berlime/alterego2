## My first encounter with GitHub

All I knew about GitHub was some sort of place where you dump codes and make it available to the public. But still, I have no idea what is the purpose of it, at all. Until Tasnim, enlightened me what it really was.
See, of course I've watched a few YouTube videos of what GitHub is, I kind of get the idea but do not know how it works, what is it for, etcetera.

Even I watched hundreds of online videos, articles and blogs, I was still confused. Many people say it is a versioning system. Versioning what? Fine, codes, but for what?! Why would you do that?
This is all changed when Tasnim introduced me to a [Static Site Generator](https://mdtasnim.com), [Hugo](https://gethugo.io).

It's a learning journey for me, especially when I am running a web design agency. This kind of stuffs is a requirement for any developers. Yup, I dove in late, into this world of 'code'.

## Knowledge is important, so does practice

Only after I learn about Static Site Generator. Which also another set of learning curve. I now understand how to use GitHub, as a beginner, getting started and getting familiarized with the user interface.

I recently bought a course on JavaScript, there is a GitHub section. Which of course, I ignored that module. Until I have been publishing a few posts, which not necessarily through GitHub, but it's just for the sake of practicing and learning.

I revisit the module, and finally it all make sense. I learned the best practices, some tricks and recently, host a website through GitHub.

This is ultimately the core basics needed, for someone like me who serve clients website projects.

The reason I post this, I want to convey a message that 'It is never too late to start.', even you think you are already doing great on something; you will be surprised how much of the fundamentals that you missed. Thanks to the technology today that makes it efficient and easy, which makes us not knowing how things work from the ground up. Don't get me wrong, technology is great, so does knowledge and practice. While these tools serves us a productivity workflow, it is also essential to know how it works, at least for me.
