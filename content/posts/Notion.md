## Notion.so - The Superpower I Stumble Upon

Notion is an app that you can decide on how do you want it to be. It is generally a note-taking app. On steroids, if you want it.
You can choose to make it as simple as a regular note-taking app, or you can also turn it into a *"super app"* like how I did, to run my agency.

I also run an internal finance insights for my agency. You see, having an accountant running a business is a must-have. Even when you subscribe a software to comply with the regulations. You still have some sort of limitation in manipulating your finance like setting aside budgets, create internal accounts for a certain category of stuffs. Well, Notion allows me to do that.

You can simply click the tags above to find out more about my Agency.

### An app that help me consolidate things, better

You see, previously, I use multiple apps to keep track of my personal stuffs, house inventory, my own personal finance, vehicle service records, purchased high ticket house equipments, etc. You name it. I got everything, literally recorded. One of the tools i used was a good ol' Microsoft Excel, as you probably guessed.

I use hundreds of apps to manage my life, both personal and business.

For people like me, cross-device syncing is also very important to me, I use all ecosystems, Windows, Apple, Android, iOS, Tablet(s) and even Linux.

It helped my really organize my stuffs and I got a lot more productive and get things done faster, believe me.

For starters, I use Notion for my CRM, Customized Finance Management, Software licensing and many more. All dynamically created, Notion also allows me to create analytics and report if I need. (Thanks to help of templates in the Notion marketplace)

#### You Should Give A Try

If you are in the market of note taking app, there is first, of course, [Notion.so](https://notion.so) and also worth mentioning [Capacities.io](https://capacities.io) which I got introduced by a good friend of mine. Capacities is an open-source option for Notion.

#### Huge shout out to [Hashim Sultan](https://www.notion4management.com/)

I stumble upon his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHeIvIzb3_4) video. The link is not a video that I stumbled upon at first, rather an update to the template that is available for sale. Yes! I bought a template for this and thank god there is an update, a powerful one. No regrets!
