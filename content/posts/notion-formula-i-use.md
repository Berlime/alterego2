// Talk about how I create Notion Formula to determine cost price.

// Talk about the calculate website cost is only calculating the servers, softwares that involves in monthly basis, for example, we use OneSuite, so we add the OneSuite cost.
When we developed it, it may use Figma, which is also a subscription cost, we do not include that cost as it is not contribute anything into the maintenance, only the initial design process.
We do not include price that has an LTD even if it is used in the production website. But we may add in a different costing class for time to keep-up with the updates of an LTD plug-ins.
Also, this cost does not includes man-hours, since the COGS we calculate is only based on plug-ins and software used.

// Also talk about, ceil, floor funtion. And the icon used in Notion that represent the formula used.hug
