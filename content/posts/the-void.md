## The Void

A raw thought from a friend of mine. Here's my take on it.

Rather, I always percieve `The Void` as a moment or a period in life where I don't know what to do. I find myself in this state quite often. Especially now, after a solid 1 year of working on my "web-development" business.

Things went very fast, little did I know, it amplified the growth of the business. But so what?
No matter how much achievements I have; I always see myself doing something to fill the void.
So the void is somehow; everything. Are we built to always fill in the void? Why all these matters?

What are we really doing? Sure, we are building a business, but what is the purpose of it all?

## The Purpose

I believe when we are clear of something; have really great clarity and a vivid vision of small action-steps. That void will just gracefully open up for you and only you; and that's the self-motivation that you sometimes realise that you are all hyped up and energized all of a sudden to work on it. The moment when you sit up straight from leaning back on your chair.

That self-motivation you suddenly have does not comes from thin air. It comes from the clarity of the purpose. Passing through the void and reach your heart and created a door. A portal.

Things may not seem never enough for one, but the reality is, that the vast of emptiness which I may regard as The Void is ever-lasting. An undiscovered territory. Lingering in the minds, waiting for a purpose.

Which I also call. The unknown. The future.

And that is why; humans always wants more. We seek purpose. We seek meaning. We seek to fill the void. We seek to discover the unknown.

It is The Faith.
